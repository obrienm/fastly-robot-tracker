### Fastly robot tracker

A [play](http://www.playframework.com/) application originally used to parse syslogs from [Fastly](http://www.fastly.com/) in realtime. However, my advice is to use [Logstash](http://logstash.net/) instead.

This is an example project showing how to parse syslogs in real time and extract robot data.
